# Collatz Conjecture Visualization

Web app to visualize Collatz conjecture, also known as the 3n + 1 problem.  
Users can input a positive and negative integers, and the app will generate a Collatz sequence for that integer and display it on the chart.

## Features

- Build Collatz sequences for different input integers.
- Visualize multiple Collatz sequences on the same chart.
- Dynamically update the chart with new sequences without losing previous ones.

## Usage

1. Enter a positive integer in the input field.
2. Click the "Build Sequence" button to generate and display the Collatz sequence on the chart.
3. Repeat the process to add multiple sequences to the chart.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- JavaScript
- Chart.js
